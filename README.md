# BreezeEnhancedCatppuccin

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a fork of [BreezeEnhanced](https://github.com/tsujan/BreezeEnhanced) that changes the colors of the **Close**, **Maximize** and **Minimize** buttons to match the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) color scheme. It works very well with the [Catppuccin KDE Theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/kde) and it **fixes the famous rounded corners bug (blur not respecting the rounded corners and 'leaking')**.

## Overview

BreezeEnhanced is a fork of KDE Breeze decoration with the following changes:

 * The optional title-bar gradient is smooth and has a configurable intensity.
 * The title-bar opacity is configurable.
 * A very mild light line is added to the top of title-bar (especially for dark color schemes) and the separator between title-bar and window is removed.
 * By default, the close, minimize and maximize buttons are macOS-like and their sizes change on mouse-over when animation is enabled.
 * The spacing between buttons is configurable.
 * Opaqueness, opacity override and flatness are added to the exception list properties.
 * Title-bar font is set indpendent from the KDE font settings (for use outside KDE).

```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arithefirst/BreezeEnhancedCatppuccin/main/build.sh)
```
If you prefer a manual installation, clone this repository, open a terminal inside the source directory and run the following.

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DKDE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=ON
